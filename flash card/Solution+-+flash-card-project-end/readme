Flashy: A Data-Driven Flashcard App
A Python-based learning tool for mastering French vocabulary using spaced-repetition logic.

### Project Overview
Flashy is a GUI-based application designed to help users learn new languages. It utilizes Pandas for data persistence and Tkinter for a smooth, interactive user interface. The app features a self-correcting dataset that tracks user progress by removing known words from the study queue.

### Key Features
Automated Card Flipping: Integrated asynchronous timing to flip cards from French to English after a 3-second delay.

Progress Persistence: Automatically generates a words_to_learn.csv to ensure users pick up exactly where they left off.

Robust Error Handling: Implemented try-except-else blocks to handle missing datasets and ensure zero-crash execution.

Dynamic UI: Real-time canvas updates with specific layering for images and text assets.

### Technical Logic & Architecture
Data Management (Pandas)

The app treats the CSV as a database. Using the to_dict(orient="records") method, the data is transformed into a list of dictionaries for O(1) access speed during random selection.

State Control (Tkinter after)

To prevent logic overlaps (Race Conditions), the app cancels the previous timer every time a new card is generated:

Python
window.after_cancel(flip_timer)
Execution Flow

Check for existing progress: If no progress file is found, it fallbacks to the master French dataset.

Display Card: A random word is chosen and rendered on the "Front" canvas.

Start Timer: A 3000ms countdown begins.

User Input: * Checkmark: The word is removed from the list and the CSV is updated.

Cross: The word stays in the list for future review.

Flip: If no action is taken, the card flips to reveal the English translation.

### Technologies Used
Language: Python 3.x

Library: Tkinter (GUI)

Data Analysis: Pandas (Data Transformation)

File I/O: CSV management with to_csv and read_csv

### How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed.

Install requirements: pip install pandas.

Run the application: python main.py.
