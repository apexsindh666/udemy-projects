Each time you cross successfully, the difficulty increases as cars move faster.

Clean, modular code organized into classes (Player, CarManager, Scoreboard)

Turtle module (comes built-in with Python)
Run the game using:
python main.py
📝 main.py Code
import time
from turtle import Screen
from player import Player
from car_manager import CarManager
from scoreboard import Scoreboard

screen = Screen()
screen.setup(width=600, height=600)
screen.tracer(0)

player = Player()
car_manager = CarManager()
scoreboard = Scoreboard()

screen.listen()
screen.onkey(player.go_up, "Up")

game_is_on = True

while game_is_on:
    time.sleep(0.1)
    screen.update()
    car_manager.create_car()
    car_manager.move_cars()

    # Detect collision with car
    for car in car_manager.all_cars:
        if car.distance(player) < 20:
            game_is_on = False
            scoreboard.game_over()

    # Detect successful crossing
    if player.is_at_finishline():
        player.goto_start()
        car_manager.level_up()
        scoreboard.increase_level()

screen.exitonclick()
🏁 Objective
Cross the road safely.
Reach the top → Level up → Cars move faster → Repeat.
How many levels can you survive? 😄
