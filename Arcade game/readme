## 🧠 How the Game Works

1. Ball moves continuously across the screen.
2. Paddles move vertically based on keyboard input.
3. If the ball hits a paddle → it bounces back.
4. If the ball misses a paddle → opposite player scores.
5. Scoreboard updates instantly.

## 🎯 Objective

Defend your side of the screen and score points on your opponent.
The game continues until you decide to stop playing.

## 📌 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `turtle` module (included with Python)
